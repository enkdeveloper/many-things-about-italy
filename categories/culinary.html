                </ul>
                <h6>Instructions:</h6>
                <p>1. Prepare the artichokes by trimming off the tough outer leaves and cutting off the top third of each artichoke. Rub cut surfaces with lemon to prevent browning.<br>
                    2. In a bowl, mix together chopped garlic, parsley, mint, salt, and black pepper.<br>
                    3. Stuff the garlic and herb mixture between the leaves of each artichoke.<br>
                    4. Place stuffed artichokes in a deep pot or Dutch oven, stem side down.<br>
                    5. Drizzle olive oil over the artichokes and pour white wine into the pot until it reaches about halfway up the artichokes.<br>
                    6. Cover the pot and cook over low heat for about 30-40 minutes, or until the artichokes are tender when pierced with a fork.<br>
                    7. Serve the artichokes hot, drizzled with cooking juices and garnished with additional chopped herbs if desired.</p>
