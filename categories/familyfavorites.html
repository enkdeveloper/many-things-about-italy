                    3. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the seasoned beef and cook until browned on all sides.<br>
                    4. Remove the beef from the Dutch oven and set aside. Add diced onion and minced garlic to the pot, and sauté until softened.<br>
                    5. Sprinkle flour over the onions and garlic, stirring to coat. Cook for a few minutes to remove the raw flour taste.<br>
                    6. Deglaze the pot with red wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom.<br>
                    7. Return the browned beef to the pot, along with diced potatoes, sliced carrots, beef broth, tomato paste, bay leaves, and fresh thyme.<br>
                    8. Bring the stew to a simmer, then cover the Dutch oven and transfer it to the preheated oven.<br>
                    9. Cook the stew in the oven for about 2-3 hours, or until the beef is tender and the vegetables are cooked through.<br>
                    10. Remove the bay leaves and thyme sprigs before serving. Serve the beef stew hot, garnished with chopped fresh parsley if desired.</p>
